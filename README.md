# git-demo

This is a short demo on using git!
Keep in mind that you should have a terminal open, commands in this format:
> $ command<br>> output

are done in the terminal.
If you don't have git installed simply run
> $ sudo apt install git

## Step 1. Creating your account
This step is very simple, simply go to github.com and click on the 'Sign Up' button.
If you already have an account then you can simply sign in

## Step 2. Creating an empty Github repo

##### NOTE: I DON'T ALWAYS REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT EACH BUTTON SAYS, BUT YOU CAN GO OFF THE GIST OF WHAT I WRITE IN QUOTES

In the top right, click on that '+' icon and select 'New repository', give it a name (like git-demo), and leave the rest of the options untouched, as this is simply a demo, not an actual project

Instantly click on the 'creating a new file' and call it 'README.md'
This is a markdown file, that are often used because of how easily they can be converted to html.
I suggest you always make one of these, even if it is not used, as it will be your first commit (save).

Next, go to the bottom of the page, you will see a smaller box, and a larger box. These are used to give descriptions of changes made, you can leave these blank, as there is going to be a default message: 'Create README.md', in this case.

Now, click on the green button that says 'Commit changes' and you will be brought to a project view.

## Step 3. Getting and saving the SSH keys

##### NOTE: THIS ONLY NEEDS TO BE DONE ONCE, BUT YOU CAN MAKE SEPARATE KEYS FOR EACH REPO

### Generate key, rsa is the type, 4096 is the strength, the email is the email 
> $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "e.mail@example.com"

Upon being prompted, save the keys in the default file path given (usually something like 'home/<user>/.ssh/id_rsa')
You will get a public key (labelled with .pub extension) and a private key (without an extension).

### Add key to Github keys
Next, use the *cat* command to copy the contents of the public key into the terminal
> $ cat home/<user>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Now copy all of the contents of the file (keep in mind that Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V don't do what you think they do in a shell). I suggest you use Ctrl+Shift+C and Ctrl+Shift+V in the terminal, or even just right-click on the selected text and select 'Copy' to be safe.

Now go to your Github, click on your account in the top-right, and select 'Settings', on the tab on the left side of the screen, select 'SSH and GPG keys' and click on 'New Key' (make sure you are adding an SSH key). Simply paste the public key into the box.

The point of this is that the public key was generated with the private key, so by having the private key, you can prove that you are authorized to do what you are doing.

### Add key to git identities

First, start the ssh-agent in the background
> $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"<br>> Agent pid 59666

##### NOTE: number is probably going to be something other than 59666

If you're using macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later, you will need to modify your ~/.ssh/config file to automatically load keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain.
Keep in mind that your key may not be called id_rsa, but what you named it during generation.

```
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes<
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Last, add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent and store your passphrase in the keychain.
> $ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa

##### NOTE: -K OPTION IS APPLE'S STANDARD VERSION OF ssh-add, WHICH STORES THE PASSPHRASES IN YOUR KEYCHAIN FOR YOU WHEN YOU ADD AN SSH KEY TO THE ssh-agent. IF YOU GET AN ERROR, SIMPLY REMOVE THE PARAMETER AND TRY AGAIN. 

## Step 4. Cloning this repo down to your folder

Navigate to the directory in which you want to store your project (i.e. if you want to store it in ~/Documents/<name_of_repo>/, navigate to ~/Documents/).

Next, go to your project and click on the green 'Code' button, and select SSH, as this is what we just set up. Copy the link.
Next, execute this command
> $ git clone git@repo_domain

The files in your repo will magically appear. Now you can change directory to the repo directory using the *cd* command. You will now see some sort of indication that you are in a git repository from your terminal prompt.

## Step 5. Learning the commands

You should now be familiar with *git clone*. Let's get started with other commands.

### add
Let's get started by creating a file called file.txt (obviously this is applicable with other files).
Your terminal should have some sort of indication that there have been changes made, and you are not synced with your Github repository (usually something like 'âœ—').

To add changed files you can do a few things.

To apply all changes you can do
> $ git add -A

or 
> $ git add .

To only add file.txt
> $ git add file.txt

Or add all files that end in .txt
> $ git add *.txt

etc.

To learn more about *git add* check out the docs: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add

### status
To check all the different files, and their status run the command
> $ git status

You will see your files, they may be ready to be committed, or they haven't been added, etc.

### commit
Once all your files that you want to commit have been added, you should commit them.
However, you have a commit message accompanying your commit.

If you want a short message, you can simply do it like this:
> $ git commit -m "commit message"

However, if you want a more descriptive and complicated message, simply write:
> $ git commit

And you will be brought to a text editor where you can write your message.
If you want to change the editor you want to write the message in, you can change your .gitconfig file, or:
> $ git config --global core.editor "vim"

where 'vim' is your editor of choice (and I do recommend vim for this). 

To learn more about *git add* check out the docs: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit

### push
##### NOTE: YOU CAN ONLY PUSH IF YOUR LOCAL REPO IS SYNCED WITH THE ONLINE ONE
Let's now that the files are committed, you can push them to your Github repository.

Use the command
> $ git push origin master

As long as you cloned the repository, 'origin' will be set up by default, however, if you didn't clone and started from the local repo, you can simply add the origin of a repo.
> $ git remote add origin git@repo_domain

##### NOTE: YOU HAVE TO CREATE A GITHUB REPO TO REMOTELY CONNECT TO IT

Now origin will be set up for you.
But let's make one more small change. Let's say I don't want to write out the 'origin master' part every time I want to push; you can also set up the origin as the default place to push, to do this we upstream it
> $ git push -u origin master

Now we only have to write *git push* and it will automatically push to origin.

### pull
To start, create a file called pull.txt, and fill it with any text you want, make sure you commit.
Now we want to sync our local workspace with the Github repository. To do so, we want to use the same link we just used for git clone, and simply put it after *git pull*.
> $ git pull git@repo_domain

Now you should see that your workspace is synced with the online repo.

## Step 6. branching
